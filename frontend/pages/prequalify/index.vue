      *** Monthly payments are based on a lender-published interest rate of
      7.25% (7.58% APR) with 10% down for 300 months. For example: APR is
      calcuated with a sales price of $150,000 and $15,000 down payment, with a
      loan amount of $135,000 and $4,050 in fees. We are not the lender, finance
      company, originator, or bank and make no credit decisions. The published
      monthly payments are for example purposes only. Your monthly payments will
      vary based on lender, credit score, credit history, interest rate, down
      payment, loan amount, originating fees, closing costs, and/or other
      underwriting requirements of the lender. The actual APR and monthly
      payment will vary based on the lenderâ€™s fees, points, loan amount, finance
      charges, and other factors.
